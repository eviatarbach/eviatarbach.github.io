  abstract = {Oscillatory modes of the climate system are among its most predictable features, especially at intraseasonal time scales. These oscillations can be predicted well with data-driven methods, often with better skill than dynamical models. However, since the oscillations only represent a portion of the total variance, a method for beneficially combining oscillation forecasts with dynamical forecasts of the full system was not previously known. We introduce Ensemble Oscillation Correction (EnOC), a general method to correct oscillatory modes in ensemble forecasts from dynamical models. We compute the ensemble mean\textemdash or the ensemble probability distribution\textemdash with only the best ensemble members, as determined by their discrepancy from a data-driven forecast of the oscillatory modes. We also present an alternate method that uses ensemble data assimilation to combine the oscillation forecasts with an ensemble of dynamical forecasts of the system (EnOC-DA). The oscillatory modes are extracted with a time series analysis method called multichannel singular spectrum analysis (M-SSA), and forecast using an analog method. We test these two methods using chaotic toy models with significant oscillatory components and show that they robustly reduce error compared to the uncorrected ensemble. We discuss the applications of this method to improve prediction of monsoons as well as other parts of the climate system. We also discuss possible extensions of the method to other data-driven forecasts, including machine learning.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of filtering dynamical systems, possibly stochastic, using observations of statistics. Thus, the computational task is to estimate a time-evolving density ρ(v, t) given noisy observations of the true density ρ†; this contrasts with the standard filtering problem based on observations of the state v. The task is naturally formulated as an infinite-dimensional filtering problem in the space of densities ρ. However, for the purposes of tractability, we seek algorithms in state space; specifically, we introduce a mean-field state-space model, and using interacting particle system approximations to this model, we propose an ensemble method. We refer to the resulting methodology as the ensemble Fokker–Planck filter (EnFPF). Under certain restrictive assumptions, we show that the EnFPF approximates the Kalman–Bucy filter for the Fokker–Planck equation, which is the exact solution to the infinite-dimensional filtering problem. Furthermore, our numerical experiments show that the methodology is useful beyond this restrictive setting. Specifically, the experiments show that the EnFPF is able to correct ensemble statistics, to accelerate convergence to the invariant density for autonomous systems, and to accelerate convergence to time-dependent invariant densities for non-autonomous systems. We discuss possible applications of the EnFPF to climate ensembles and to turbulence modeling.},

After analyzing its steady-state properties, we apply the model to each mountain glacier worldwide and estimate regionally differentiated response times and sensitivities to ELA changes. We use a statistical method from the family of global sensitivity analysis methods to determine the glacier quantities, geometric and climatic, that most influence the model output. The response time is dominated by the climatic setting reflected in the mass-balance gradient in the ablation zone, followed by the surface slope, while volume sensitivity is mainly affected by glacier size, followed by the surface slope.},

  abstract = {Predicting the temporal and spatial patterns of South Asian monsoon rainfall within a season is of critical importance due to its impact on agriculture, water availability, and flooding. The monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO) is a robust northward-propagating mode that determines the active and break phases of the monsoon and much of the regional distribution of rainfall. However, dynamical atmospheric forecast models predict this mode poorly. Data-driven methods for MISO prediction have shown more skill, but only predict the portion of the rainfall corresponding to MISO rather than the full rainfall signal. Here, we combine state-of-the-art ensemble precipitation forecasts from a high-resolution atmospheric model with data-driven forecasts of MISO. The ensemble members of the detailed atmospheric model are projected onto a lower-dimensional subspace corresponding to the MISO dynamics and are then weighted according to their distance from the data-driven MISO forecast in this subspace. We thereby achieve improvements in rainfall forecasts over India, as well as the broader monsoon region, at 10- to 30-d lead times, an interval that is generally considered to be a predictability gap. The temporal correlation of rainfall forecasts is improved by up to 0.28 in this time range. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the predictability of intraseasonal oscillations to improve extended-range forecasts; more generally, they point toward a future of combining dynamical and data-driven forecasts for Earth system prediction.},

  abstract = {Due to the physical coupling between atmosphere and ocean, information about the ocean helps to better predict the future of the atmosphere, and in turn, information about the atmosphere helps to better predict the ocean. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal nature of this predictability: where, for how long, and at what frequencies does the ocean significantly improve prediction of the atmosphere, and vice versa? We apply Granger causality, a statistical test to measure whether a variable improves prediction of another, to local time series of sea surface temperature (SST) and low-level atmospheric variables. We calculate the detailed spatial structure of the atmosphere-to-ocean and ocean-to-atmosphere predictability. We find that the atmosphere improves prediction of the ocean most in the extratropics, especially in regions of large SST gradients. This atmosphere-to-ocean predictability is weaker but longer-lived in the tropics, where it can last for several months in some regions. On the other hand, the ocean improves prediction of the atmosphere most significantly in the tropics, where this predictability lasts for months to over a year. However, we find a robust signature of the ocean on the atmosphere almost everywhere in the extratropics, an influence that has been difficult to demonstrate with model studies. We find that both the atmosphere-to-ocean and ocean-to-atmosphere predictability are maximal at low frequencies, and both are larger in the summer hemisphere. The patterns we observe generally agree with dynamical understanding and the results of the Kalnay dynamical rule, which diagnoses the direction of forcing between the atmosphere and ocean by considering the local phase relationship between simultaneous sea surface temperature and vorticity anomaly signals. We discuss applications to coupled data assimilation.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) is a key component of many forecasting models in science and engineering. DA allows one to estimate better initial conditions using an imperfect dynamical model of the system and noisy/sparse observations available from the system. Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a DA algorithm that is widely used in applications involving high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. However, EnKF requires evolving large ensembles of forecasts using the dynamical model of the system. This often becomes computationally intractable, especially when the number of states of the system is very large, e.g., for weather prediction. With small ensembles, the estimated background error covariance matrix in the EnKF algorithm suffers from sampling error, leading to an erroneous estimate of the analysis state (initial condition for the next forecast cycle). In this work, we propose hybrid ensemble Kalman filter (H-EnKF), which is applied to a two-layer quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow as a test case. This framework utilizes a pre-trained deep learning-based data-driven surrogate that inexpensively generates and evolves a large data-driven ensemble of the states to accurately compute the background error covariance matrix with smaller sampling errors. The H-EnKF framework outperforms EnKF with only dynamical model or only the data-driven surrogate, and estimates a better initial condition without the need for any ad-hoc localization strategies. H-EnKF can be extended to any ensemble-based DA algorithm, e.g., particle filters, which are currently too expensive to use for high-dimensional systems.},

Here, we propose three components, inspired by physics, to integrate with commonly used DDWP models in order to improve their forecast accuracy. These components are (1) a deep spatial transformer added to the latent space of U-NET to capture rotation and scaling transformation in the latent space for spatiotemporal data, (2) a data-assimilation (DA) algorithm to ingest noisy observations and improve the initial conditions for next forecasts, and (3) a multi-time-step algorithm, which combines forecasts from DDWP models with different time steps through DA, improving the accuracy of forecasts at short intervals. To show the benefit and feasibility of each component, we use geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis and examine the short-term forecast accuracy of specific setups of the DDWP framework. Results show that the spatial-transformer-based U-NET (U-STN) clearly outperforms the U-NET, e.g., improving the forecast skill by 45 \%. Using a sigma-point ensemble Kalman (SPEnKF) algorithm for DA and U-STN as the forward model, we show that stable, accurate DA cycles are achieved even with high observation noise. This DDWP+DA framework substantially benefits from large (O(1000)) ensembles that are inexpensively generated with the data-driven forward model in each DA cycle. The multi-time-step DDWP+DA framework also shows promise; for example, it reduces the average error by factors of 2\textendash 3. These results show the benefits and feasibility of these three components, which are flexible and can be used in a variety of DDWP setups. Furthermore, while here we focus on weather forecasting, the three components can be readily adopted for other parts of the Earth system, such as ocean and land, for which there is a rapid growth of data and need for forecast and assimilation.},

This allows observations to have an instantaneous impact across boundaries such as the air-sea interface when estimating the state of each individual component. Operational prediction centers are moving toward Earth system modeling for all forecast timescales, ranging from days to months. However, there have been few studies that examine fundamental aspects of SCDA and the transition from traditional approaches that apply data assimilation only to a single component, whether forecasts were derived from a coupled model or an uncoupled forced model. The SCDA approach is examined here in detail using numerical experiments with a simple coupled atmosphere-ocean quasi-geostrophic model. The impact of coupling is explored with respect to its impact on the Lyapunov spectrum and on data assimilation system stability. Different data assimilation methods are compared within the context of SCDA, including the 3-D and 4-D Variational methods, the ensemble Kalman filter, and the hybrid gain method. The impact of observing system coverage is also investigated. We find that SCDA is generally superior to weakly coupled or uncoupled approaches. Dynamically defined background error covariance estimates are essential for SCDA to achieve an accurate coupled state estimate as the observing system becomes sparser. As a clarification of seemingly contradictory findings from previous studies, it is shown that ocean observations can adequately constrain atmospheric state estimates provided that the analysis-observing frequency is sufficiently high and the ensemble size determining the background error covariance is sufficiently large.},

Our results indicated insignificant impacts on LST during the daytime but significant warming of 0.10 \textdegree C of annual mean nighttime LST averaged over all wind farms, and 0.36 \textdegree C for those 61\% wind farms with warming. The nighttime LST impacts exhibited seasonal variations, with stronger warming in winter and autumn, up to 0.18 \textdegree C, but weaker effects in summer and spring. We observed a decrease in peak normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 59\% of wind farms due to infrastructure construction, with an average reduction of 0.0067 compared to non-wind farm areas. The impacts of wind farms depended on wind farm size, with winter LST impacts for large and small wind farms ranging from 0.21 \textdegree C to 0.14 \textdegree C, and peak NDVI impacts ranging from -0.009 to -0.006. The LST impacts declined with the increasing distance from the wind farm, with detectable impacts up to 10 km. In contrast, the vegetation impacts on NDVI were only evident within the wind farm locations. Wind farms built in grassland and cropland showed larger warming effects but weaker vegetation impact than those built on forests. Furthermore, spatial correlation analyses with environmental factors suggest limited geographical controls on the heterogeneous wind farm impacts and highlight the important role of local factors. Our analyses based on a large sample offer new evidence for wind farm impacts with improved representativeness compared to previous studies. This knowledge is important to fully understand the climatic and environmental implications of energy system decarbonization.},

Using MODIS data, we quantified the effects of solar farms (SFs) on albedo, vegetation (using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as a proxy), and land surface temperature (LST) based on 116 large SFs across the world. The results show that the installation of SFs decreased the annual mean surface shortwave albedo by 0.016 ± 0.009 (mean ± 1 STD) and reduced the EVI by 0.015 ± 0.019 relative to the surrounding areas. SFs produced a strong cooling effect of −0.49 ± 0.43 K in the annual mean land surface temperature during the daytime and a weaker cooling effect of −0.21 ± 0.25 K during the nighttime. The greatest impacts on albedo and daytime LST were observed in barren land, followed by grassland and cropland, while the opposite order applied for vegetation impact. In terms of seasonal and latitudinal variations, the largest impact was observed at high latitudes in winter on albedo, at mid-latitudes in summer on vegetation, and at low latitudes in spring–summer transitions on daytime LST. Correlation analysis showed that the albedo and LST impacts were enhanced over large SFs with high capacity. The vegetation and LST impacts were both correlated with geographic and climatic factors and dependent on the type of SF (photovoltaic or concentrating solar power). Our global assessment provides observational evidence for the effects of SF construction on the environment and local climate, which can help the sustainable development of solar energy.},

To do so, we characterize the spatio-temporal variability of annual mean sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-level pressure (SLP) using Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis (M-SSA). We applied M-SSA to ERA5 reanalysis data (1959–2022) of South Atlantic SST and SLP, both individually and jointly, and identified a nonlinear trend, as well as two climate oscillations. The leading oscillation, with a period of 13 years, consists of a basin-wide southwest–northeast dipole and is observed both in the individual variables and in the coupled analysis. This mode is reminiscent of the already known South Atlantic Dipole, and it is probably related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and to El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean. The second oscillation has a 5-year period and also displays a dipolar structure. The main difference between the spatial structure of the decadal, 13-year, and the interannual, 5-year mode is that, in the first one, the SST cold tongue region in the southeast Atlantic’s Cape Basin is included in the pole closer to the equator. Together, these two oscillatory modes, along with the trend, capture almost 40% of the total interannual variability of the SST and SLP fields, and of their co-variability. These results provide further insights into the spatio-temporal evolution of SST and SLP variability in the South Atlantic, in particular as it relates to the South Atlantic Dipole and its predictability.}
