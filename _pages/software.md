An R package that extends the functionality of other plotting packages like
`ggplot2` and `lattice` to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time
intervals, including, but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological
data. The primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also included to assist
with other areas of deep time visualization.
