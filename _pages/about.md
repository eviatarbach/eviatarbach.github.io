I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Mathematics of Environmental Data Science at the University of Reading, in the departments of [Meteorology](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) and [Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.reading.ac.uk/maths-and-stats/).

My research interests include data assimilation, predictability, machine learning, climate dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics, and more broadly in climate justice.
