I am a Stanback Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Environmental Science in the [CliMA group](https://clima.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, under the supervision of [Tapio Schneider](https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/) and [Andrew Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/).

My research interests include predictability, climate dynamics, data assimilation, and nonlinear dynamics, and more broadly in climate justice.
