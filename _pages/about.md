I am a Stanback Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Environmental Science in the [CliMA group](https://clima.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, under the supervision of [Tapio Schneider](https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/) and [Andrew Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the [Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique](https://www.lmd.jussieu.fr/) at the École Normale Supérieure, Paris, under the supervision of [Michael Ghil](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/people/michael-ghil). Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park in the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science](https://www.atmos.umd.edu/), under the supervision of [Eugenia Kalnay](http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/) and [Safa Mote](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5905-3842). Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, studying computer science, physics, and mathematics.

My research interests include predictability, climate dynamics, data assimilation, and nonlinear dynamics, and more broadly in climate justice.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
